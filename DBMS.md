### **Data**
ðŸ‘‰ *Raw facts and figures.*

It can be **anything** â€“ numbers, text, images â€“ that by itself doesn't make much sense.

**Example:**  
`"23", "Apple", "1999"` â€“ these mean nothing on their own.

---

### **Information**
ðŸ‘‰ *Information is the Processed data with meaning.*

When data is organized and given context, it becomes information.

**Example:**  
`"Apple was founded in 1976"` â€“ now you know *what*, *who*, and *when* â€” this is information!

---

### **Database**
ðŸ‘‰ *It is an organized collection of data where data is stored in such structured and organised manner that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.*

**Example:**  
A table of students with columns like Name, Roll No., Marks â€“ all stored in one place.

### **DBMS (Database Management System)**
ðŸ‘‰ *Software that interacts with the database to insert, update, retrieve, and manage data.*

Basically, itâ€™s the tool you use to **talk to the database**.
